# Generative Modeling

This repository contains resources, code, and experiments related to generative modeling in deep learning. Generative models are a class of machine learning models that aim to generate new data samples similar to a given dataset.

## Features

- Implementation of popular generative models such as:
    - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
    - Diffusion Models
- Tutorials and notebooks for understanding the concepts.
- Pre-trained models and examples for quick experimentation.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

VAEs aim to model the data distribution \( p(x) \) by introducing a latent variable \( z \). The model maximizes the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):

\[
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{q(z|x)}[\log p(x|z)] - D_{\text{KL}}(q(z|x) \| p(z))
\]

where:
- \( q(z|x) \) is the approximate posterior.
- \( p(z) \) is the prior distribution.
- \( D_{\text{KL}} \) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GANs consist of a generator \( G \) and a discriminator \( D \) trained in a minimax game:

\[
\min_G \max_D \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\text{data}}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))]
\]

where:
- \( p_{\text{data}}(x) \) is the data distribution.
- \( p_z(z) \) is the prior noise distribution.

### Diffusion Models

Diffusion models learn to reverse a diffusion process that gradually adds noise to data. The training objective is to minimize the variational bound:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{diffusion}} = \mathbb{E}_{q(x_t|x_0)} \left[ \| x_t - \mu_\theta(x_t, t) \|^2 \right]
\]

where:
- \( x_t \) is the noisy data at time \( t \).
- \( \mu_\theta \) is the predicted mean by the model.

## Applications of Generative Models

Generative models have a wide range of applications across various domains:

- **Image Generation**: Creating realistic images, art, and textures.
- **Text Generation**: Generating coherent text for tasks like chatbots and story writing.
- **Audio Synthesis**: Producing realistic speech, music, and sound effects.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhancing datasets for training machine learning models.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying outliers by modeling the normal data distribution.
- **Drug Discovery**: Designing new molecules with desired properties.

These applications demonstrate the versatility and potential of generative models in solving real-world problems.
